These are the files that allows for one to install macOS Monterey using the installer than can be downloaded on the Dortania guide using a command. 

Keep in mind that EFIs should be created per system, not downloaded and used from various sources as issues may occur that one may not know how to diagnose - it is simply easier to know what you are doing and fix it rather than have to go through many files and the config.plist in order to find what you are looking for.
